## Overview

This system implements state-of-the-art computer vision techniques to automatically identify and rank peak action moments in recreational sports photography. Designed specifically for HiFy's use case of processing ~100 pre-filtered frames per 10-minute sports video, the system combines pose estimation, object detection, and quality assessment to surface the most compelling action shots.

### Key Capabilities
- **Automatic Action Detection**: Identifies serves, forehands, backhands, volleys, and athletic movements
- **Multi-Sport Support**: Optimized for pickleball, tennis, and similar racket sports
- **Quality Filtering**: Removes blurry, poorly framed, or low-quality images
- **Scalable Processing**: Handles 1000+ images with GPU acceleration

## Technical Methods

### 1. Pose Detection and Action Recognition

#### MediaPipe BlazePose Integration
- **Model**: MediaPipe BlazePose with model_complexity=2 (highest accuracy)
- **Keypoints**: 33 3D landmarks covering full body
- **Confidence Threshold**: 0.5 for detection

#### Athletic Pose Scoring Algorithm
```python
Athletic Score = Σ(
    Knee Bend Score (0-3) +      # Angles between 120-170°
    Stance Width Score (0-3) +    # Normalized ankle distance
    Forward Lean Score (0-2) +    # Torso angle from vertical
    Dynamic Position Score        # Body asymmetry
)
```

#### Action Classification Logic
The system classifies actions based on keypoint positions:
- **Serve**: Both arms up, wrist above shoulder height
- **Forehand**: Right wrist high, body rotation detected
- **Backhand**: Left wrist high, opposite rotation
- **Volley**: Arms forward, bent knees
- **Lunge**: Wide stance, low center of gravity

#### Motion Intensity Calculation
```python
Motion Intensity = f(
    Wrist Height Score,          # Above shoulder = +4
    Arm Extension Score,         # >150° angle = +3
    Body Rotation Score,         # Shoulder-hip alignment
    Feet Movement Score          # Spread and elevation
)
```

### 2. Ball Detection and Interaction Analysis

#### YOLOv8 Configuration
- **Model**: YOLOv8m (medium) for balanced speed/accuracy
- **Classes**: COCO class 32 (sports ball), 37 (tennis racket)
- **Confidence Threshold**: 0.25 for initial detection

#### Ball Selection Algorithm
When multiple balls detected:
1. Calculate confidence × height_ratio for each ball
2. Prioritize balls in air (higher position)
3. Estimate motion blur in ball region
4. Select ball with highest composite score

#### Player-Ball Interaction Scoring
```python
Interaction Score = (
    Proximity Score (0-8) +      # Minimum distance to hands/racket
    Height Bonus (0-2) +         # Ball elevation from ground
    Motion Blur Bonus (0-1) +    # Fast-moving ball indicator
    Action Context Bonus (0-2)   # Based on detected action type
)
```

### 3. Frame Quality Assessment

#### Multi-Scale Sharpness Analysis
- **Overall Sharpness**: Laplacian variance on full image
- **Subject Sharpness**: Center-weighted region (50% of frame)
- **Normalization**: variance/100, capped at 10.0

#### Composition Quality Metrics
1. **Rule of Thirds**: Distance from subject center to power points
2. **Dynamic Diagonal**: Player alignment along diagonal
3. **Action Space**: Free space in movement direction
4. **Framing**: Subject size and margin from edges

#### Technical Quality Scoring
```python
Technical Score = mean(
    Subject Sharpness,
    Exposure Quality,    # LAB luminance analysis
    Contrast Score       # Standard deviation of L channel
)
```

### 4. Weighted Scoring System

#### Base Weights
```python
weights = {
    'peak_action_score': 0.25,
    'ball_interaction': 0.20,
    'motion_intensity': 0.15,
    'athletic_pose': 0.10,
    'subject_sharpness': 0.10,
    'composition_score': 0.10,
    'technical_quality': 0.10
}
```

#### Sport-Specific Modifiers
```python
modifiers = {
    'pickleball': {'ball_interaction': 1.2, 'athletic_pose': 1.1},
    'tennis': {'motion_intensity': 1.2, 'peak_action_score': 1.1},
    'badminton': {'motion_intensity': 1.3, 'ball_interaction': 0.9}
}
```

#### Final Score Calculation
```python
Total Score = Σ(metric × weight × sport_modifier) + bonuses

Bonuses:
- Pose + Ball detected: +1.0
- High-value actions (serve/forehand/backhand): +0.5
```
